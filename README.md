# DevMeetup_WebApplication
This repository contains ASP.Net section of [LEARNING_devMeetups](https://github.com/Nulloket/LEARNING_devMeetups).

This ASP.Net solution consists of the API in Project `DevMeeting` and ~~IdentityServer4 as IDP in `DevMeeting.IDP`~~ (I'll replace it)

Further more here will be how to setup the project yourself and how you can customize it to your needs.
